2. Move orders from the data location to the installation folder location (&amp;quot;%ProgramFiles%\Storj\Storage Node\orders&amp;quot; by default) (PowerShell):
robocopy /MIR /MOVE D:\Storj\orders &amp;#34;$env:ProgramFiles\Storj\Storage Node\orders&amp;#34; 3. Point to the same exact storage folder where you were previously storing the data.</description></item><item><title>Migrating from Windows GUI installation to Docker CLI</title><link>/node/resources/faq/migrate-my-node/migrating-from-windows-gui-installation-to-a-docker-cli/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/migrate-my-node/migrating-from-windows-gui-installation-to-a-docker-cli/</guid><description>Migrating from Windows GUI installation to Docker CLI # Preparing the destination system # 1.

2. Install Docker
On Windows we recommend to install version 2.1.0.5. We do not recommend using later versions as a lot of bugs have been reported. 3.

The Windows GUI version stores data in the path specified in the storage.</description></item><item><title>How to migrate the Windows GUI node from one physical location to another?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/migrate-my-node/how-to-migrate-the-windows-gui-node-from-a-one-physical-location-to-other/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/migrate-my-node/how-to-migrate-the-windows-gui-node-from-a-one-physical-location-to-other/</guid><description>How to migrate the Windows GUI node from one physical location to another? # To be able to move an existing node to a different physical location (different PC) we should transfer both the node&amp;rsquo;s identity and the data. It is neither sufficient to only migrate the identity nor to only move the data to the new location, we need to do both.
First, we need to know where the identity is currently stored on your original machine.</description></item></channel></rss>
