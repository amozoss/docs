In production, we have 12-hour windows and a 30-day tracking period, which translates to 60 windows per tracking period and two windows a day. Every single audit the storage node gets will affect its online score to some extent. For example, if a node got audited during 30 seconds of downtime, that offline audit will have a negative effect on the online_score of the storage node.</description></item><item><title>Where can I check for a new version?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/where-can-i-check-for-a-new-version/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/where-can-i-check-for-a-new-version/</guid><description>Where can I check for a new version? # We have a proposal for the Storage Nodes Operators - let&amp;rsquo;s work together and keep our network up to date to offer a great service to our Customers!

Until then, a great way to stay updated with your Node&amp;rsquo;s status is to use UptimeRobot.
UptimeRobot will check to see if your port is listening every x minutes. When your port is not listening, you will receive an e-mail alerting you that your port is closed, meaning there&amp;rsquo;s something going on with your Node.</description></item><item><title>What if my machine restarts or shuts down?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/machine-restart-shutdown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/machine-restart-shutdown/</guid><description>What if my machine restarts or shuts down? # If you have properly mounted your hard drive (if on Linux, using static mount via /etc/fstab), then your Node should start up again automatically after your machine has rebooted.
However, power failures on machines not protected by a UPS or other abrupt disconnections may cause database corruption leading to errors such as: database error: database disk image is malformed or database: file is not a database in your logs).</description></item><item><title>How do I shutdown my node for system maintenance?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/system-maintenance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/system-maintenance/</guid><description>How do I shutdown my node for system maintenance? # If you need to shutdown the Storage Node for maintenance on your system, run:

This model optimizes liveliness by deterring Nodes to exit the network without transferring their pieces (thus limiting repair costs). Importantly, this strikes an equilibrium between a very low cost of entry for Nodes while also way to insulate against the cost of data repair.
Nodes don&amp;rsquo;t need to provide any up-front stake to start earning STORJ tokens as a Storage Node Operator.</description></item><item><title>How do I change values like wallet address or storage capacity?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/how-do-i-change-my-parameters-such-as-payout-address-allotted-storage-space-and-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/how-do-i-change-my-parameters-such-as-payout-address-allotted-storage-space-and-bandwidth/</guid><description>How do I change values like wallet address or storage capacity? # 1.

lsblk -d -fs /dev/&amp;lt;location (example: sda2)&amp;gt; Copy the UUID, as well as the FSTYPE. Weâ€™ll need that later.
Next, we will create a new directory in the /mnt folder where you want your Storj files to be stored; you can name this directory whatever you would like.</description></item><item><title>How do I estimate my potential earnings for a given amount of space and bandwidth?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/how-do-i-estimate-my-potential-earnings-for-given-amount-of-space-and-bandwidth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/how-do-i-estimate-my-potential-earnings-for-given-amount-of-space-and-bandwidth/</guid><description>How do I estimate my potential earnings for a given amount of space and bandwidth? # We have a great Community Earnings Estimator to give you an idea how much time it may take to fill your provided free disk space and how much you may earn.
Please be aware - this is only an estimator, not a calculator. Unlike for mining cryptocurrencies, the estimated potential earnings are not guaranteed because the space and bandwidth are used by real people, not machines.</description></item><item><title>Why am I not storing more data?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/storing-more-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/storing-more-data/</guid><description>Why am I not storing more data? # The most important aspect to increase the amount of data stored on your Node (and thus maximizing payout) is to build reputation of your Nodeâ€™s ID over an extended period of time**.**
When a Node first joins the network, there is a probationary period, during which the Node has to prove itself (e.g. maintaining a certain uptime and performance levels, passing all content audits).</description></item><item><title>Why is the network not using all of my storage and bandwidth?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/storage-bandwidth-usage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/storage-bandwidth-usage/</guid><description>Why is the network not using all of my storage and bandwidth? # The quick answer is, your Node&amp;rsquo;s reputation is still growing. The Node isn&amp;rsquo;t yet storing stripes of frequently accessed pieces. Luckily for Storage Node Operators, weâ€™ve optimized the network to provide the maximum amount of bandwidth allocation based on the operation of a single node in a bandwidth-constrained environment.
This means that running a single Node per location (where one location = a discrete network with separate IP address and bandwidth/bandwidth cap) will yield the best results (highest reputation, most storage contracts from satellites and most earned STORJ tokens) for Storage Node Operators.</description></item><item><title>Why are my payouts so low?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/low-payouts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/low-payouts/</guid><description>Why are my payouts so low? # If you believe you should have gotten higher payouts, please run the earnings estimator and then compare each Satelliteâ€™s payouts to the amount you received in the transactions sent to your payout address for the month in question. Please wait to submit any support ticket until we have announced that all payouts have been completed for the month. Payouts are sent monthly, in the first two weeks after the month being paid is done.</description></item><item><title>How do I estimate my payouts per Satellite?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/estimate-payouts/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/estimate-payouts/</guid><description>How do I estimate my payouts per Satellite? # If you would like to estimate how much you can expect to get paid for running your Node during a given month, please follow the instructions here.
This information is also available on the Web-dashboard (docker) or Web-dashboard for Windows/Linux GUI.
The script above can be used to check the estimations displayed on the dashboard and correctness of payout. If your node is working properly, the values for both sources should almost be the same.</description></item><item><title>What if I'm using a remote connection?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/remote-connection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/remote-connection/</guid><description>What if I&amp;rsquo;m using a remote connection? # If you must use a remote connection, due to the length of time it takes for some of the steps, it&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended to run them inside a virtual console like TMUX or SCREEN.

All nodes behind the same subnet /24 of a public IP are treated as a single node for ingress traffic and as separate ones for egress traffic (to the customers, repair and audit) - this is because we want to be decentralized as much as possible.</description></item><item><title>Where can I find the config.yaml?</title><link>/node/resources/faq/where-can-i-find-a-config-yaml/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/node/resources/faq/where-can-i-find-a-config-yaml/</guid><description>Where can I find the config.yaml? # Docker The config.yaml is created in your storage location when you did the initial setup of the storagenode.
For example, if your --mount option in your docker run command looks like --mount type=bind,source=/mnt/storj/storagenode,destination=/app/config, then the config.yaml will be in the /mnt/storj/storagenode location. Options and parameters specified in the docker run command have a precedence over options in the config.yaml - Only options not also specified in the docker run command will be taken from the config.</description></item></channel></rss>
