By encrypting file-paths, content, and metadata client-side, we avoid the danger of making this data available to attackers, and anyone else who is unable to derive the necessary encryption keys.
The network&amp;rsquo;s encryption method is purposely designed to avoid using the same keys for content encryption of different files and different segments of the same file.</description></item><item><title>Design Decision: End-to-end Encryption</title><link>/dcs/concepts/encryption-key/design-decision-end-to-end-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/concepts/encryption-key/design-decision-end-to-end-encryption/</guid><description>Design Decision: End-to-end Encryption # Strong encryption is critical to decentralized projects especially where a significant part of the infrastructure is run by independent third-party providers. Encryption is especially important with data storage to deliver security + privacy and ensure developers are in control of their data.
End-to-end encryption means that only you have access to your data and the associated metadata. If end-to-end encryption is essential to your use case, Storj DCS provides the Uplink CLI, libuplink library, a variety of developer tools including FileZilla and Rclone, and the self-hosted GatewayST that allow you to ensure data and metadata are encrypted before they ever reach any service operated by Storj or any other third party.</description></item><item><title>Design Decision: Server-side Encryption</title><link>/dcs/concepts/encryption-key/design-decision-server-side-encryption/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/concepts/encryption-key/design-decision-server-side-encryption/</guid><description>Design Decision: Server-side Encryption # Strong encryption is critical to decentralized projects especially where a significant part of the infrastructure is run by independent third-party providers. Encryption is especially important with data storage to deliver security + privacy and ensure developers are in control of their data.
It&amp;rsquo;s also important to enable the broadest range of use cases for object storage, and some of those use cases rely on server-side encryption for privacy and security.</description></item></channel></rss>
