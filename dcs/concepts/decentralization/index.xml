The network does not need global consistency (as per CAP Theorem) as each uplink user only needs to be able to recover their files.
Advantages Over Coordination-dependant Systems # By ensuring coordination avoidance within Storj DCS, we’re able to deliver better performance and scalability over other decentralized systems—two issues that are critical to achieving broad adoption with traditional storage users.</description></item></channel></rss>
