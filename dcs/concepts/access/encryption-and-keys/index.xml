Please make sure you clearly understand how encryption keys are used on Storj DCS. You, your application and/or your users are responsible for managing your encryption keys.
If you lose your encryption keys, you have lost the ability to decrypt your data rendering it useless.</description></item><item><title>When to use different encryption keys</title><link>/dcs/concepts/access/encryption-and-keys/when-to-use-different-encryption-keys/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/concepts/access/encryption-and-keys/when-to-use-different-encryption-keys/</guid><description>When to use different encryption keys # With encryption embedded into Access Grants, it is possible to create multiple Access Grants with the same access authorization but different encryption keys. The default behavior of the Uplink Client is not to display data that the Uplink Client cannot decrypt. It is possible to view the data in it&amp;rsquo;s encrypted state, but it is not possible to derive an encryption key or otherwise reverse engineer an encryption key from an Access Grant with authorization to read data, if that Access Grant does not have an encryption key scoped to the data in question.</description></item></channel></rss>
