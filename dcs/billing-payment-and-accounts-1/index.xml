Note that if no valid payment method remains on an account, usage limits may be reduced to zero. If all credit cards expire or are invalid, or the STORJ token balance is exhausted and no new payment method is added on a project, after a reasonable time and opportunity to add a payment method, we reserve the right to reclaim the available resources (the storage space and bandwidth made available by Storage Node Operators to the Storj network) and delete the data from Storj DCS if a valid payment method is not added and any unpaid fees are not paid.</description></item></channel></rss>
