Coupon - Any valid Coupon on an account will first be used to pay an invoice amount. If the entire invoice is paid with Coupons, no further debits are made in that billing cycle. If, after all Coupons are exhausted in a billing cycle, a balance on an invoice remains, the balance will be debited using the next available payment method; Credits - After applying any Coupons, any valid Credit on an account will then be used to pay an invoice amount.</description></item><item><title>Changing Payment Methods</title><link>/dcs/billing-payment-and-accounts-1/storj-token/changing-payment-methods/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/billing-payment-and-accounts-1/storj-token/changing-payment-methods/</guid><description>Changing Payment Methods # Users may change payment methods on accounts, but at least one valid payment method must be configured on an account at all times.

Still, sometimes unanticipated issues can arise.
If the issue is with a credit card payment, please start by submitting a support ticket through our Storj DCS support portal. We will attempt to resolve the issue prior to escalating with Stripe.
If the issue is with a STORJ token transaction, you should first contact CoinPayments to confirm that your STORJ token transaction was received by CoinPayments.</description></item></channel></rss>
