Uploads will be erasure-coded locally, thus a 1gb upload will result in 2.68gb of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.
Use this pattern for # The strongest security The best download speeds Setup # First, Download and extract the rclone binary onto your system.</description></item><item><title>Rclone with Hosted Gateway</title><link>/dcs/how-tos/sync-files-with-rclone/rclone-with-hosted-gateway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/how-tos/sync-files-with-rclone/rclone-with-hosted-gateway/</guid><description>Rclone with Hosted Gateway # Selecting an Integration Pattern # Use our S3 compatible Hosted Gateway integration pattern to increase upload performance and reduce the load on your systems and network. Uploads will be encrypted and erasure-coded server-side, thus a 1GB upload will result in only in 1GB of data being uploaded to storage nodes across the network.
Use this pattern for # Reduced upload time Reduction in network load By selecting this integration pattern you are opting in to server-side encryption Prerequisites # Generate Credentials to the Gateway MT # Navigate to the Access page within your project and then click on Create Access Grant +.</description></item></channel></rss>
