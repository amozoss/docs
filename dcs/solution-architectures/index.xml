Object storage has formed the backbone of many different applications and use cases. Distributed and decentralized object storage is optimized for larger files, especially where those files are accessed regularly from geographically diverse locations.
Object storage, in general, has a wide range of use cases.</description></item><item><title>Common Architectural Patterns</title><link>/dcs/solution-architectures/common-architectural-patterns/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/dcs/solution-architectures/common-architectural-patterns/</guid><description>Common Architectural Patterns # There are a standard set of integration patterns in which the Storj Uplink is implemented. This section provides a solution architecture overview of the following integration patterns.
Platform/Service Description Decentralized Advantage Cloud-hosted Gateway S3-compatible cloud hosted gateway providing elastic object storage capacity Easy implementation and broad compatibility. Note: uses server-side encryption Hybrid Cloud On Premise Gateway On-premis to cloud elastic storage capacity Enhanced privacy via end-to-end encryption Cloud Native Applications Web-based applications interact with S3-compatible cloud hosted gateway Server-side encryption and industry-leading access management controls with highly distributed network of storage nodes make it easy to build more secure and private applications Mobile Apps Choose libuplink library for end-to-end encryption or S3-compatible cloud hosted gateway for ease of integration Take advantage edge-based delegated authorization for secure and private file sharing Command Line File Transfer Command line tool for end-to-end encrypted large file transfer between people or environments Fast, easy, secure, private and economical way to move large files Client App Integration Integrate libuplink into applications with native cloud storage use Easily integrate secure, private and economical cloud object storage inn your app (Examples FileZilla, Rclone and Restic) Dapp Integration Add decentralized object storage to your decentralized app S3 compatibility, default multi-region high availability via a network of decentralized storage nodes, and enhanced security and privacy through delegated authorization.</description></item></channel></rss>
